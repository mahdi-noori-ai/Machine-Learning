# Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

This notebook demonstrates the use of **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**, a powerful ensemble learning method that builds models sequentially, where each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous models. It is widely used for tasks such as classification and regression due to its ability to handle complex patterns in the data.

## Features

- **Gradient Boosting Algorithm**: Step-by-step implementation of the GBM technique using decision trees as base learners.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the data for model training and testing, including splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
- **Model Training**: Trains the GBM model on the training data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates the performance of the trained model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: (Optional) You can modify and tune different hyperparameters of the GBM model to achieve better performance.

## How Gradient Boosting Works

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique where multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) are trained in sequence. Each subsequent learner corrects the mistakes of the previous ones by minimizing a loss function. The final model is a weighted sum of all weak learners.

### Steps Involved in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load a dataset (such as a classification or regression dataset) to be used for training the model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize/standardize numerical features.

3. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

4. **Training the GBM Model**:
   - Train a Gradient Boosting model using libraries such as `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` or `GradientBoostingRegressor` for classification and regression tasks, respectively.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
   
   model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model performance using metrics like:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1 Score
   - You can use `sklearn.metrics` to compute these metrics.

   Example:
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
   print("Precision:", precision_score(y_test, y_pred))
   print("Recall:", recall_score(y_test, y_pred))
   ```

6. **Visualization (Optional)**:
   - Visualize the training progress, decision boundaries, or feature importances.
   - Use libraries such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualizations.

## How to Run

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Load the notebook in Jupyter or any other environment (such as Google Colab).
   - Run the cells in sequence to load the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Modify Hyperparameters**:
   - You can tune hyperparameters like `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, etc., to improve model performance.

## Example Dataset

If no specific dataset is provided, common datasets such as the `Iris` dataset for classification or the `Boston Housing` dataset for regression can be used.

Example:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target
```

## Model Hyperparameters

The GBM model offers several hyperparameters that can be tuned:
- `n_estimators`: The number of boosting stages (trees) to be run. Higher values may lead to overfitting.
- `learning_rate`: Shrinks the contribution of each tree. Smaller values require more trees.
- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the trees. Higher values can lead to overfitting.
- `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples required to split a node.
- `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples in a leaf node.

## Performance Considerations

Gradient Boosting can be computationally expensive, especially with larger datasets. Consider tuning hyperparameters like `n_estimators` and `learning_rate` for a balance between model accuracy and runtime.
