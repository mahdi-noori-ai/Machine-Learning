# PCA and Whitening

This notebook demonstrates **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a popular dimensionality reduction technique, along with **whitening**. PCA is used to transform a dataset into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. Whitening is an extension of PCA that scales the principal components to have unit variance.

## Features

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.
- **Whitening**: Normalizes the principal components to ensure that they have unit variance, which can be useful for certain machine learning models that are sensitive to the variance of the input data.
- **Explained Variance**: Compares the explained variance of the principal components with and without whitening.

## How PCA Works

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms the data into a new coordinate system where the greatest variance comes to lie on the first coordinate (first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on. It is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.

### Whitening

Whitening is a step that normalizes the data by ensuring that the principal components have unit variance. This can sometimes improve the performance of machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scaling of input features.

## Dependencies

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
   The notebook begins by preparing a dataset, which could be synthetic data or a real-world dataset such as `Iris` or a similar dataset.

2. **Applying PCA**:
   - The PCA algorithm is applied to the dataset without whitening to reduce its dimensionality.
   - The principal components are computed, and the explained variance ratio for each component is displayed.

   Example:
   ```python
   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

   pca = PCA(n_components=2)
   X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)
   print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
   ```

3. **Applying PCA with Whitening**:
   - Whitening is applied during the PCA transformation to normalize the principal components.
   - The notebook compares the explained variance ratio of PCA with and without whitening.

   Example:
   ```python
   pca_whitened = PCA(n_components=2, whiten=True)
   X_pca_whitened = pca_whitened.fit_transform(X)
   print(pca_whitened.explained_variance_ratio_)
   ```

4. **Comparison of Results**:
   The explained variance ratio is compared between the standard PCA and the PCA with whitening to analyze the effect of whitening.

   Example output:
   ```python
   Explained Variance (without Whitening): [0.73, 0.22]
   Explained Variance (with Whitening): [0.73, 0.22]
   ```

5. **Visualizing Principal Components**:
   The notebook provides code to visualize the transformed data along the first two principal components using `matplotlib`.

   Example:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], label="PCA")
   plt.scatter(X_pca_whitened[:, 0], X_pca_whitened[:, 1], label="PCA with Whitening")
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load Your Data**:
   Replace the dataset with your own dataset. Ensure the data is numerical and properly scaled.

2. **Run PCA and Whitening**:
   Run the cells to apply PCA and whitening to your data, and observe how much variance each component explains with and without whitening.

3. **Interpret the Results**:
   Look at the explained variance ratios and the visualizations to understand how much of the variance is captured by the principal components. Compare the results with and without whitening.

## Example

Here is a basic example of how to perform PCA with and without whitening on a dataset:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

# Example dataset
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)

# Standard PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)
print("Explained Variance (without Whitening):", pca.explained_variance_ratio_)

# PCA with Whitening
pca_whitened = PCA(n_components=2, whiten=True)
X_pca_whitened = pca_whitened.fit_transform(X)
print("Explained Variance (with Whitening):", pca_whitened.explained_variance_ratio_)
```

## Conclusion

This notebook provides an intuitive understanding of PCA and whitening and their impact on dimensionality reduction. By comparing the explained variance with and without whitening, you can make informed decisions about whether or not to include the whitening step in your workflow.
