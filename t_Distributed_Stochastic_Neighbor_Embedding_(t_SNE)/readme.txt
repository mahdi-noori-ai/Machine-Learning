# t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

This notebook demonstrates the use of **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**, a powerful machine learning technique used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. t-SNE is particularly effective at visualizing high-dimensional data by projecting it into two or three dimensions while preserving the local structure of the data.

## Features

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces high-dimensional data to 2D or 3D for visualization purposes.
- **Preserves Local Structure**: t-SNE attempts to preserve the distances between similar data points, making it useful for clustering and understanding data patterns.
- **Visualization of High-Dimensional Data**: By projecting data into 2D/3D, t-SNE enables us to visualize complex relationships between data points in a lower-dimensional space.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, make sure the following libraries are installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How t-SNE Works

t-SNE maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D) while maintaining the structure of the data by minimizing the divergence between distributions of points in high-dimensional space and their projections. t-SNE is particularly useful for visualizing clusters and patterns in data.

### Steps Involved in the Notebook

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess a high-dimensional dataset (for example, MNIST, Iris, or a similar dataset).
   - Ensure the data is in numerical format and standardized.

2. **Applying t-SNE**:
   - t-SNE is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The number of target dimensions is usually set to 2 or 3 for visualization.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

   tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
   X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)
   ```

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the results of the t-SNE projection using `matplotlib`.
   - Color the data points based on their labels to observe clustering behavior.

   Example:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.scatter(X_tsne[:, 0], X_tsne[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis')
   plt.colorbar()
   plt.title("t-SNE Projection")
   plt.show()
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load Data**:
   Load a dataset with high-dimensional features. Common datasets used with t-SNE include the **Iris dataset**, **MNIST**, or any other dataset with more than two features.

2. **Apply t-SNE**:
   Use the `TSNE` class from `sklearn.manifold` to reduce the dataset to two or three dimensions. Ensure you set `n_components=2` or `n_components=3` depending on your visualization preference.

3. **Visualize**:
   Use `matplotlib` to create scatter plots of the reduced data. Optionally, color the points according to labels or clusters to make patterns more visible.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how t-SNE is applied to a dataset:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Apply t-SNE
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)

# Visualize the results
plt.scatter(X_tsne[:, 0], X_tsne[:, 1], c=y, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("t-SNE Projection of Iris Dataset")
plt.show()
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Computational Complexity**: t-SNE can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets. Consider using a smaller sample of data for quicker results or exploring the use of the **Barnes-Hut t-SNE** algorithm (`method='barnes_hut'`), which is more efficient for larger datasets.
- **Perplexity**: The `perplexity` parameter controls the balance between local and global aspects of the data in t-SNE. Adjusting this parameter may lead to better visualizations depending on your data.

## Conclusion

t-SNE is a versatile tool for visualizing high-dimensional data. This notebook provides an easy-to-follow implementation of t-SNE using `scikit-learn`. You can apply this technique to any dataset where visualizing clusters or patterns in high-dimensional space is useful.
