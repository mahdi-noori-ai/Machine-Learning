# Iris Dataset Classification

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is designed for analyzing the Iris dataset, a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning. The primary objective is to build and evaluate models that can accurately classify iris species based on various flower features.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Task and Purpose
The main task is to use machine learning techniques to classify the iris species based on the provided features. This notebook explores different models and techniques to find the most accurate classification approach.

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset is inspected, and key statistics are visualized to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between them.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Label encoding is used to convert categorical target labels (iris species) into numerical form.
   - Data is split into training and testing sets to allow for model training and evaluation.
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Polynomial features are generated to capture interactions between features.
   - Standard scaling is applied to standardize the feature values.
5. **Model Building**:
   - Several regression models, such as Lasso Regression and ElasticNet Regression, are built using a pipeline that includes polynomial feature generation and scaling.
6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to assess their accuracy in predicting the species.
