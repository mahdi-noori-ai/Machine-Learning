# CPU Performance Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is designed for analyzing CPU performance data. The primary objective is to build and evaluate predictive models that can estimate CPU performance metrics based on various input features, such as cache size, clock speed, and the number of cores.

## Dataset
The notebook likely uses a CPU performance dataset that includes various features related to CPU specifications and performance metrics. This dataset might be obtained from a public repository or a specific source related to CPU benchmarks.

## Task and Purpose
The main task is to utilize machine learning models to predict CPU performance metrics, such as processing power or benchmark scores. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationships between CPU specifications and performance, and to build a model that can accurately predict CPU performance based on input features.

## Workflow
1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: The dataset is imported and preprocessed, which may include handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This step involves visualizing the data, analyzing feature distributions, and identifying correlations between CPU specifications and performance metrics.
3. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are selected for model training. This step may involve dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or selecting features based on correlation.
4. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks, are trained on the dataset to predict CPU performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared to assess their accuracy and effectiveness.
6. **Model Comparison and Selection**: The notebook compares the performance of different models and selects the best-performing one for predicting CPU performance.
7. **Conclusion**: The final section summarizes the findings, discusses the implications of the results, and suggests potential improvements or further analysis.
