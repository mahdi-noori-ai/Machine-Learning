__pycache__/
env/
venv/
.idea/

# Jupyter Notebooks
.ipynb_checkpoints

# Data
*.csv
*.hdf5
*.pkl
*.zip


### 6. **Adding Projects**

For each field, create projects with their own `README.md` explaining:

- **Introduction**: A brief overview of the project.
- **Data**: The data used in the project.
- **Methodology**: The machine learning techniques applied.
- **Results**: The outcomes and performance metrics.
- **Usage**: Instructions on how to use the project code.

### 7. **Push to GitHub**

1. Initialize the repository locally:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2. Add all files:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3. Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
4. Push to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    git push -u origin master
    ```
